  "In this web app, you will learn how to say all of the JLPT vocab just by listening and repeating, so try to relax and repeat each word the best you can. We will be using spaced-repetition which will make it easier for you to learn these words over time. The most important part is to make sure you do this every day. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day. This sounds difficult, but it's actually easy once it becomes a habit. This habit should be effortless - ideally you can listen while doing other things like exercising or doing chores. Let's begin.";
