# JLPT Audio SRS

Learn and review JLPT vocab by just listening.

An audio-based JLPT SRS web app built with the T3 stack (React, TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS).

The goal of this web app is to make reviewing JLPT vocab effortless - you can listen and have this web app playing in the background while you're doing other things like exercising.

This web app works entirely offline and saves your data locally so you don't have to worry about having an internet connection while using this web app.
