# JLPT Vocab Audio SRS

An audio-based JLPT SRS web app built with the T3 stack (React, TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS). This web app helps you review JLPT vocab in a relaxing way so you can listen and practice while you do other things.

The goal of this web app is to make reviewing JLPT vocab effortless - you can start the web app and have it playing in the background while you're doing other things like exercising or doing chores.
