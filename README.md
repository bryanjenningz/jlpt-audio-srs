# JLPT Audio SRS

Learn and review JLPT vocab by just listening.

An audio-based JLPT SRS web app built with the T3 stack (React, TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS).

The goal of this web app is to make reviewing JLPT vocab effortless - you can listen and have this web app playing in the background while you're doing other things like exercising or doing chores.
